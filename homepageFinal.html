                <h3 Style = "color: black" > - Though all of the SDGs I looked at had some form of success during the recording period in the United States, the level of success definitely varied.
                </h3>
                <h3 Style = "color: black" > - Educational Expenditure: This SDG had an overall success; however, a few caveats keep it from being a total success. These include the fact that it was neccessary to limit this visualization to only the top 10 states for each category and that there were instances where states lowered their funding during the period. The limitation of the states inherantly limits the amount of cases that I could see; there could be other failures hidden. The fact that some regions were absent from one or both suggests that they may have a regional issues with funding. In the areas without representation on either bar race, as well as those states that decreased funding, this is a point that needs to be focused on.
                </h3>
                <h3 Style = "color: black" > - Scoring: Overall scoring has improved, including moving slightly closer to gender equality in standardized scores. However, especially in mathematics scores, there were mixed results, with some of the outliers moving away from gender equality instead of towards it. Additionally, many of the other unmarked points had minimal change towards the gender equality line. Thus, the success for scoring was mixed. This is the SDG that needs to be considered on the most universally in terms of policy focus.
                </h3>
                <h3 Style = "color: black" > - Degrees: This was the most total success out of the SDGs I looked at. All regions improved their percentages during the period, so this can be classified as a complete success.
